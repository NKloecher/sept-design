APPLICATION IDEAS:

Pictures from thailand in pleasing manner
Wishes in a single page app (maybe /wishes)
Move wishes from index to wishes

Could use a template from the web....... meh

Be clear on Schema & Connection handling
-> Is sending it with middleware the correct solution?
-> Only the model is sent, individual routes handle their own queries. Might be okay.
-> Stick with this model for now.

Implement login.
->Rename user as (people)?
->Have User refer to actual users able to login
-> technically don't even need to current user schema, but eh, it's okay.

The library idea ain't half bad.
->

Revisit the navbar -> remove current dropdown in favor of better overview (blocks?)


OTHER:

Utilize Pluralsight material while able to.
Decent videos
